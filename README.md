Hi!!
We are ByteBuddies!!

Version 1.1:
In this iteration of the game, upon execution, it currently displays a blank window. To address this issue, the constructor method should be renamed to _init_ with double underscores at the beginning and end. The original code provided in version 1 utilizes init with single underscores, resulting in the constructor not being invoked when an instance of the class is created, thereby causing the blank window. After rectifying this error, an additional feature will be implemented. Following the conclusion of a game, a message box will prompt the user with the inquiry, "Would you like to play again?" The user will be presented with the options "Yes" or "No.
